# Summary:

## December temperatures are lower than June temperatures, as would be expected. But the average is similar, from 71 in December to 75 in June. 

## The surf and ice cream shop would probably not see significant changes in customers, based on temperatures alone.

## Other queries recommended for deeper understanding.

1. Precipitation statistics would help determine how many days of business may be lost to rain in each season, despite the ambient temperature.

2. Elevation of each station may impact readings. Since surfing is done at sea level, further analysis may benefit from eliminating readings from stations at higher elevations.
