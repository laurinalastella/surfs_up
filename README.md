# Summary:

## December temperatures are lower than June temperatures, as would be expected. But the average is similar, from 71 in December to 75 in June. 

## The business would probably not see significant changes in customers, based on temperatures alone.

## Other queries recommended for deeper understanding:

### 1. Precipitation statistics would help determine how many days of business may be lost to rain in each season, despite the ambient temperature.

### 2. Elevation of each station may impact readings. Since surfing is done at sea level, further analysis may benefit from eliminating readings from stations at higher elevations.
